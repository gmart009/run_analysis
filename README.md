The run_analysis.R script uses only one function.  The extractData function.  The run_analysis.R and UCI HAR Dataset folder from the project's dataset need to be located in the working directory of RStudio.  

You may open RStudio and run through the following:

1. source("run_analysis.R")
2. extractData()  
3. The tidy dataset is created in the current working directory as tidy.txt
