The run_analysis.R script uses only one function.  The extractData function.  This function takes the path of the UCI HAR Dataset folder location.  

Once the UCI HAR Dataset folder is downloaded, you may open RStudio and run through the following:

1. Execute the following command in RStudion: source("run_analysis.R")
2. Execute the following function in RStudion:extractData([Location of UCI HAR Dataset]) 
  An example would be extractData("/Users/gmart009/Documents/UCI HAR Dataset") 
3. The tidy dataset is created in the current working directory
